# Clean Installation Compatibility

All repository changes must remain compatible with a clean installation run
through `installation_scripts/install.sh` and this repository's `install.sh`.
Do not rely on packages, files, settings, or manual steps that exist only on
the current machine. Add every required dependency, asset, configuration
step, and migration to the installer so a fresh checkout can reproduce the
complete setup.

Keep installation steps idempotent and verify the clean-install path for every
change.
